This is a small script used for automatically formatting and turning channel id's into xml files, and then adding it to your newsboat feed.
Wrote this because I was slighty annoyed with having to write "https://youtube.com/feeds/videos?=channel_id=..." multiple times.

I wrote it fairly quickly, but have revised it a bit already and plan to add a few more features because I'm too lazy to organize a text file myself. It's also good practice.
The only reason I am publishing this is so that way I can acess it easily on my other laptop, and so I can update it on either desktop or laptop.
This program isn't the most well written, but I am hoping that as I become more familliar with Python, I can add more features, and make it more optimal, and overall just less ugly.

Changes:
  - I added the main paradigm to the script just because it's good practice. 
  - I think that there were also some other minor changes but I cannot remember what they where, so that is the main thing I guess.
